# CortexMind 

CortexMind is a full-stack AI-powered chat application that simulates the functionality of modern large language model (LLM) platforms like ChatGPT and DeepSeek. This is a project that demonstrates several full-stack development skills, including real-time message streaming, authentication, API integration, and data persistence.

When a user clicks on a chat session, a request is sent to the backend to fetch all messages for that session, populating the page with the existing chat history.

### Response Style Selector

## Project Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS, Zustand
- **Backend:** Express.js, Node.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Authentication:** Auth0
- **AI Integration:** DeepSeek LLM API

---

## Key Features

- ðŸ”¹ **Real-Time AI Chat**  
  Integrates with DeepSeek's `deepseek-chat` model to stream conversational responses incrementally.

- ðŸ”¹ **Responsive UI**  
  Built with React and Tailwind CSS for a sleek and responsive chat interface.

- ðŸ”¹ **User Authentication**  
  Secure login and session handling powered by Auth0, with chat history tied to user accounts.

- ðŸ”¹ **Persistent Storage**  
  All messages and sessions are stored in PostgreSQL.

---

## How It Works

1. Users log in through Auth0.
2. Frontend sends prompts to the backend.
3. Backend communicates with DeepSeekâ€™s API, streams responses in real-time, and updates the database.
4. Stored messages are retrieved from PostgreSQL per user session.

## What I Learned

- Building real-time, stream-based chat UX
- Managing auth workflows across frontend and backend
- Structuring scalable database schemas for user-generated content
- Handling full-stack API integrations (LLM, Auth0, database)
